# GUI-based-animation-and-visualization-of-group-and-phase-velocity-using-Matlab
To create a GUI based animation to create a visualization of the following cases: 

i) Phase velocity= group velocity  
ii) Phase velocity> greater than the group velocity
iii) Phase velocity> greater than the group velocity  
iv) Non-zero phase velocity, zero group velocity  
v)  Zero phase velocity, non-zero group velocity 
vi) Phase velocity=-group velocity

**Steps for using the GUI**

1. Run the Matlab code given in previous slide
2. On the top left corner you will see a menu asking to choose among the 6 cases
3. Choose a case and animation will start
4. Close the figure to Stop the Animation
5. A menu at the top left corner will ask to see another case
6. Choose Yes or No
